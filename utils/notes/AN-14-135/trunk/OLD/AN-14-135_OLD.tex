% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been

% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{In this note we present the measurement of the differential cross section for two Z bosons produced
in association with jets, extracted from pp collision data at $\sqrt{s}$~=~8~TeV. The measurement is done
considering the processes with leptonic decays of the Z bosons in either electrons or muons.
The analysis is based on a data sample collected with the CMS Experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$. The measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes $ZZ \to \ell\ell\ell'\ell'$, 
where $\ell,\ell' = e, \mu$. The measured total cross section is $\sigma (pp\to ZZ) = 7.76 \pm 0.48 (stat.) ^{+0.27}_{0.29} (syst.)$ pb, 
for both Z bosons produced in the mass range  $60 < m_{Z} < 120$ GeV and it is consistent with Standard Model
predictions. The cross-section measured in the fiducial region corresponding to the visible phase space defined by the kinematic and geometrical acceptance of leptons is $\sigma_{pp\to ZZ \to 4\ell} =20.50 \pm 1.26~\mathrm{(stat.)}^{+0.58}_{- 0.64}~\mathrm{(syst.)}\pm 0.53~\mathrm{(lumi.)}$,
 in agreement with the SM prediction.  Differential cross sections are measured, in particular as a function of variables related to the jets
produced in the event.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
