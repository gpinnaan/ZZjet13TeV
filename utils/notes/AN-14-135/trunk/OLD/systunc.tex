Systematic uncertainties for trigger efficiency (1.5\%) are evaluated from data~\cite{ZZXSPaper}. Uncertainties
arising from lepton identification, isolation, tracking and impact parameter are 1-5\% for muons and electrons~\cite{ZZXSPaper}. The uncertainty in the LHC integrated
luminosity of the data sample is 2.6\%~\cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-13-001}. Theoretical uncertainties in the $ZZ \to \ell\ell\ell'\ell'$ 
acceptance are evaluated using \texttt{MCFM} and by varying the renormalization and factorization scales, up and down, 
by a factor of two with respect to the default values $\mu_R = \mu_F = m_Z$. The variations in the acceptance are 0.1\% (NLO
$q\bar{q} \to ZZ$) and 0.4\% ($gg \to ZZ$), and can be neglected. Uncertainties related to the choice
of the PDF and the strong coupling constant are evaluated following the \texttt{PDF4LHC} ~\cite{PDF4LHCRec, PDF4LHCRep, CT10} prescription and 
using \texttt{CT10},  \texttt{MSTW08}, and  \texttt{NNPDF}~\cite{NNPDF} PDF sets. They are found to be 1.2\% in the wider fiducial region and 0.8\% in the tighter fiducial region (fiducial regions are defined in the next section).
%4\% (NLO $q\bar{q} \to ZZ$) and 5\% ($gg \to ZZ$)~\cite{ZZXSPaper}.

The reducible background uncertainties in $Z$ + jets, $WZ$ + jets and $t\bar{t}$ yields reflect the uncertainties in the measured values of the misidentification rates and the limited statistics of the control regions in the data, and vary between 30\% and 70\% on the background yield, which corresponds to a $\sim$1\% of uncertainty on the cross-section measurement. The irreducible background uncertainty is smaller and varies between 13\% and 26\% on the yield (less than 1\% on the cross-section estimate). Table~\ref{tab:syst} summarizes the sources  of systematic uncertainty and their values.

% The uncertainty in the unfolding procedure discussed in Section 7 arises from differences between
% SHERPA and POWHEG for the unfolding factors (2–3%), from scale and PDF uncertainties
% (4–5%), and from experimental uncertainties (4–5%).
