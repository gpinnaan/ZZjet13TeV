% >> Authors
%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases
%For multiple affiliations, create an address entry for the combination
%To mark authors as primary, use the \author* form

\address[unito]{Universi\`a degli Studi di Torino and INFN.}
\address[infnto]{INFN Torino.}
\address[hig]{The Higgs to four leptons team.}

% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{This note reports the measurement of the differential cross sections of two Z bosons produced in association with jets in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13~\mathrm{TeV}$. This analysis is based on a data sample collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $12.9~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes $\mathrm{ZZ}\to\ell\ell\ell'\ell'$, where $\ell,\ell' = e, \mu$. 
}

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
