The differential pp~$\to \Z\Z\to \ell\ell\ell'\ell'$ cross section is determined as a function of the jet multiplicity, the invariant mass of the two most energetic jets ($m_{jj}$), the 
difference in pseudorapidity between them ($\Delta\eta_{jj}$), their transverse momentum and pseudorapidity 
(leading jet $p_{T}(\eta)^{jet1}$ and sub-leading jet $p_{T}(\eta)^{jet2}$). Both jets with  $|\eta^{jet}|<4.7$ and 
central jets with $|\eta^{jet}|<2.4$ are considered separately. Measurements are performed in a fiducial region, called ``wide region'',  defined by requiring the invariant mass of each Z boson candidate between 60 and 120 GeV. Moreover, they are also obtained in a ``tight region'', defined by requiring also leptons with $p^e_T > 7~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $|\eta^e| < 2.5$ if electrons and $p^{\mu}_T > 5~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $|\eta^{\mu}| < 2.4$ if muons, at least one lepton with $p_T > 20~\mathrm{GeV}$ and another one with $p_T > 10~\mathrm{GeV}$.
Each distribution is corrected for event selection efficiencies and for detector resolution effects in order to be 
compared with predictions from event generators. The correction procedure is based on the iterative D'Agostini's method unfolding technique~\cite{DAgostini}, implemented in the \texttt{RooUnfold} toolkit~\cite{RooUnfold}. The algorithm uses a response matrix that correlates the observable with and without detector effects.\\
For each measured distribution, a response matrix is evaluated using two different sets of generators: the first 
one is composed of signal samples generated with \texttt{MadGraph} ($\cPq\cPaq \to \Z\Z$), \texttt{MCFM} ($\cPg\cPg \to \Z\Z$) 
and \texttt{Phantom} ($\cPq\cPaq \to \Z\Z$ + 2 jets). In the second one the \texttt{Powheg} sample ($\cPq\cPaq \to \Z\Z$) is used 
instead of the \texttt{MadGraph} one. The \texttt{MadGraph} set is the reference set, while the  \texttt{Powheg} 
one is used for comparison purposes and to extract the systematic uncertainty due to the Monte Carlo generator choice. \\
Distributions of the corrected number of events are then divided by the bin width and by the integrated luminosity and are normalized to the unity. The normalized differential distributions as a function of the jet multiplicity and as a function of the invariant mass of the 4-lepton system are reported in Figs.~\ref{fig:xs_jets} and~\ref{fig:xs_mass} for the wide (left) and tight (right) fiducial regions.
