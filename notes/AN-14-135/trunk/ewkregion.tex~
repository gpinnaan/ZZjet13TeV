The scattering of two massive vector bosons (VBS) $VV\to VV$, with $V=W$ or $Z$, is the key process to probe the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In the absence of a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the longitudinally polarized VBS amplitude increases as a function of the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ and violates unitarity at energies around 1 TeV. The recent discovery of a 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson at LHC~\cite{AtlasHiggs, CMSHiggs} provides a plausible explanation for the mechanism that unitarizes this process. However, many physics scenarios predict enhancements in the VBS amplitude either from additional resonances, or if the observed SM-like Higgs boson is only partially responsible for the EWSB.\\
At hadron collider VBS can be represented by an interaction of gauge bosons radiated from initial state quarks yielding a final state with two bosons and two jets, in a purely electroweak process. Two classes of processes can generate a $VV + 2 jet$ final state: the first class, that includes also VBS processes, involves only electroweak interactions of order $\alpha_{EW}^{4}$ (\emph{electroweak production}), while the second class involves both strong and electroweak processes of order $\alpha_{S}^{2}\alpha_{EW}^{2}$ (\emph{strong production}. A fiducial region is defined in order to enhance the purity of electroweak $ZZ+2jets$ and remove most of the strong events, which are considered as background in this analysis. This region is a subset of the one we used to measure the inclusive cross section of ZZ processes (see \ref{sec:results}, in which two $Z$ bosons with had a mass between 60 and 120 GeV, and it also requires at least two jets with an invariant mass ($m_{jj}$) larger than 200 GeV and separated in pseudorapidity by $\Delta\eta_{jj}$>2.4. Moreover the leading(sub-leading) jet is required to have $p_T^>100(70)~\mathrm{GeV}$ and the magnitude of the missing transverse energy $E_T$ must be less than 60 GeV.


The aim of the analysis is find evidence for the electroweak production of same-sign
W-boson pair events. The strong production cross section is reduced by the same-sign requirement,
making the experimental signature of same-sign dilepton events with two jets an ideal
topology for VBS studies. Candidate events have exactly two identified
