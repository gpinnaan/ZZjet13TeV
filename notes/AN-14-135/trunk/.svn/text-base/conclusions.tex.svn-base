The measurement of the $ZZ$ production total and differential cross-sections in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8~\mathrm{TeV}$ 
has been presented in the leptonic decay channels  $pp \to ZZ\to \ell\ell\ell'\ell'$ with $\ell,\ell'=e,\mu$. The full 2012 dataset is used corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $19.7~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Simple sequential sets of lepton reconstruction, identification and isolation cuts and a set of kinematic cuts are used following the selection introduced in the search for the Higgs boson decaying in 4 leptons (high mass selection). The main backgrounds are estimated using Monte Carlo samples and data-driven techniques and found to be very small for $60 < m_{Z_{1}} < 120$ and $60 < m_{Z_{2}} < 120$ GeV.\\
The measured combined cross section is $\sigma_{pp\to ZZ \to 4\ell} =20.50 \pm 1.26~\mathrm{(stat.)}^{+0.58}_{- 0.64}~\mathrm{(syst.)}\pm 0.53~\mathrm{(lumi.)}$,
 in agreement with the SM prediction of $20.21^{+3.3\%}_{-2.6\%}$ fb from~\cite{grazzini}. \\
Differential distributions for jet-related variables are presented and no significant discrepancy with respect to predictions is found.\\
A tighter fiducial region is defined in order to select electroweak $ZZ$ +2 jets events. The observation of one event in this region agrees with the SM expectation.
